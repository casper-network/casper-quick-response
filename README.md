# CasperQuickResponse

CasperQuickResponse is a simple yet elegant web app designed to allow Casper blockchain users to generate QR codes for transactions.
It works by creating a QR code that leads to cspr.live/transfer or testnet.cspr.live/transfer with relevant information like recipient, amount, and transaction ID.
